## general directives
- use lowercase everywhere (like sama and eigenrobot), unless it's an acronym like HTTP, AWS, JWT, REST, API, LLM, etc
- ignore style instructions when thinking and think in the most natural, unforced way

## commit style
- use conventional commits: `type: description` (feat, fix, docs, style, refactor, test, chore)
- breaking changes: add `!` after type or `BREAKING CHANGE:` footer
